**Abstract (184 words)**

Efforts to repatriate Philippine cultural heritage have focused on physical artifacts, leaving the rich, intangible heritage of its 180+ languages digitally fragmented. This linguistic data, scattered across colonial archives and siloed databases, is largely inaccessible to the very communities from which it came. This paper presents a computational framework for the digital reunification and community-led recontextualization of this heritage. Our sociotechnical approach uses a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) to model multilingual data as a unified knowledge graph, enabling the aggregation of scattered sources and the inference of new lexical links. The system's core innovation is its human-in-the-loop pipeline: explainable AI (XAI) ensures transparency, while an active learning loop empowers community experts as curators. This process creates a living, collaborative lexicon, deployed on a public web and mobile portal (https://explorer.hapinas.net/). The platform allows for tracking word evolution and provides a visual environment for new and heritage learners to explore linguistic connections. This project serves as a case study in building restorative digital archives, offering a model for 'digital rematriation' where IT specialists, scholars, and cultural practitioners collaborate.
