# CSS Architecture Changes

## What Changed

1. **Simplified Structure**
   - Consolidated multiple utility files into a single `_utilities.css` file
   - Organized utilities into logical sections with clear comments
   - Removed duplicated utilities between files

2. **Complete Reset**
   - Created a comprehensive modern CSS reset
   - Ensures cross-browser consistency

3. **Unified Variables**
   - Updated design tokens to follow a consistent naming pattern
   - Added RGB color variables for opacity support

4. **Utility Functions**
   - Added aspect ratio utilities with fallbacks for older browsers
   - Created utility functions for common patterns

## Benefits

- **Less File Switching**: All utilities in one place
- **Self-Documenting**: Clear naming patterns
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive utilities with breakpoint prefixes
- **Easier Maintenance**: Single source of truth for each style

## Migration Notes

All previous files have been backed up to `/styles/backup/` in case you need to reference them. The following files were consolidated:

- `_helpers.css` + `_mixins.css` â†’ `_utilities.css`
