# Frontend Performance Fix Guide

This guide provides solutions to address the slow startup times and caching issues in the Filipino Root Word Explorer application.

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Excessive CSS Size and Complexity**
   - Large CSS files (WordExplorer.css: 31.8KB, WordDetails.css: 22.1KB)
   - Cascading CSS imports causing potential race conditions
   - Duplicate style rules, especially in dark mode overrides

2. **Circuit Breaker Implementation**
   - Aggressive localStorage clearing on startup
   - Inefficient API connection handling and caching
   - Blocking operations during initial render

3. **Multiple Utility Scripts**
   - Confusing array of CSS fix/backup/restore scripts
   - Lack of coordination between utility scripts

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Performance Optimization Script (`performance-fix.js`)
- Safely clears corrupted localStorage entries
- Preserves important user settings
- Sets startup flags to defer non-critical operations
- Preloads critical CSS files

### 2. CSS Optimizer (`optimize-css.js`)
- Removes duplicate CSS rules
- Organizes CSS imports properly
- Combines duplicate media queries
- Cleans up whitespace and formatting

### 3. Circuit Breaker Improvements
- Reduced frequency of cache clearing
- Added timeout to defer circuit breaker reset
- Implemented tracking to prevent multiple resets

### 4. New NPM Scripts
- `npm run optimize-css`: Runs the CSS optimization
- `npm run clear-cache`: Clears problematic cache entries
- `npm run clean-start`: Performs all optimizations and starts the app

## How to Fix Performance Issues

### Immediate Fix (One-Time)

1. **Clear your browser's cache completely**:
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy and Security → Clear browsing data
   - Firefox: Options → Privacy & Security → Cookies and Site Data → Clear Data
   - Edge: Settings → Privacy, search, and services → Clear browsing data

2. **Run the clean start command**:
   ```
   npm run clean-start
   ```

### Ongoing Maintenance

1. **Run CSS optimization after CSS changes**:
   ```
   npm run optimize-css
   ```

2. **If the app becomes slow again**:
   ```
   npm run clear-cache
   ```

## Long-Term Improvements

1. **CSS Architecture Improvements**
   - Consider migrating to CSS-in-JS or styled-components
   - Split large component CSS files into modular files
   - Use CSS variables more consistently

2. **API Optimization**
   - Implement proper caching with service workers
   - Use React Query or SWR for data fetching
   - Add proper loading states to prevent UI blocking

3. **Circuit Breaker Redesign**
   - Move circuit breaker state to React context
   - Use a more efficient approach to API fallbacks
   - Consider using IndexedDB instead of localStorage for caching

## Monitoring

To verify the performance improvements:
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to the Performance tab
3. Record a full page load
4. Check for reduced time to interactive and layout shifts

If CSS optimization is working correctly, you should see:
- Faster initial page load (under 2 seconds)
- Smoother theme switching
- No flash of unstyled content

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
1. Delete `node_modules` and reinstall dependencies
2. Clear all browser cache and cookies
3. Try running in a private/incognito window
4. Check console for error messages
5. Verify localStorage contents using DevTools Application tab
