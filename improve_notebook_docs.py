## Overview

This notebook implements active learning strategies combined with explainability techniques for the Filipino Lexical Resource (FilRelex) project. The goal is to iteratively improve model performance through intelligent data selection while maintaining interpretability of the learned representations.

### Key Components:
- **Active Learning**: Strategies for selecting the most informative samples for labeling
- **Explainability**: Techniques to understand and interpret model decisions  
- **Filipino Language Processing**: Specialized handling for Filipino linguistic features
- **Graph Neural Networks**: For modeling word relationships and semantic networks

### Prerequisites:
- Google Colab environment with GPU access
- Access to FilRelex dataset in Google Drive
- Python 3.11+ with CUDA support

### Authors: FilRelex Research Team
### Last Updated: January 2025

This section manages the installation of all required packages for the active learning and explainability pipeline.

### Why Package Management is Complex

The FilRelex project requires a specific combination of packages:
- **PyTorch 2.2.2** with CUDA 12.1 support
- **DGL (Deep Graph Library)** for graph neural networks
- **HuggingFace Transformers** for language models
- **SHAP/Captum** for explainability
- **MLflow** for experiment tracking

Google Colab's pre-installed packages often conflict with our requirements, so we need to:
1. Clean uninstall conflicting packages
2. Install packages in a specific order to avoid dependency conflicts
3. Restart the runtime to load native libraries properly

### Step 3: Package Installation

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: This cell will restart the runtime after installation. You'll need to re-run cells 1-2 after the restart."""

After the runtime restart, we need to verify that all packages are installed correctly and can work together.

### Step 4: Test Critical Dependencies

- PyTorch installation and CUDA availability
- HuggingFace Transformers functionality
- SentenceTransformers compatibility
- DGL (Deep Graph Library) functionality"""

### Step 5: Training Configuration

Configure the training parameters and environment settings. Key parameters include:

- **training_device**: GPU/CPU selection for training
- **learning_rate**: Controls the step size during optimization
- **batch_size**: Number of samples processed in each iteration
- **max_epochs**: Maximum number of training epochs

### Training Process Overview

The training process includes:
1. **Model Initialization**: Set up the graph neural network architecture
2. **Data Loading**: Load and preprocess the Filipino linguistic data
3. **Active Learning Loop**: Iteratively select most informative samples
4. **Model Updates**: Update model parameters based on selected samples
5. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance and explainability"""

### Step 6: Model Analysis

1. **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
2. **Explainability Analysis**: SHAP values, attention weights, feature importance
3. **Embedding Quality**: t-SNE/UMAP visualizations of learned representations
4. **Active Learning Effectiveness**: Analysis of sample selection strategies
5. **Filipino Language Insights**: Language-specific patterns and relationships

### Analysis Components

- **POS Tagging Evaluation**: Part-of-speech prediction accuracy
- **Relationship Classification**: Word relationship prediction performance  
- **Embedding Clustering**: Semantic clustering of word embeddings
- **Feature Attribution**: Understanding which features drive predictions
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Model confidence analysis"""
