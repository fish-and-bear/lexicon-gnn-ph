# Summary of Changes to Kaikki JSONL Processing in `dictionary_manager.py`

This document summarizes the recent modifications made to the `process_kaikki_jsonl` function (specifically the nested `process_single_entry` function) and related components to improve data extraction and storage from Kaikki.org JSONL entries.

## 1. Etymology Processing Enhancements

The core logic for handling `etymology_templates` within `process_single_entry` was significantly revised:

*   **Corrected Borrowing/Derivation Logic:**
    *   Distinguished between borrowing (`bor`, `bor+`) and derivation (`der`, `derived`) templates to correctly identify the source language (`args["2"]` for borrow, `args["1"]` for derive) and source word (`args["3"]` for borrow, `args["2"]` for derive).
    *   Added a check to prevent creating word entries for empty or placeholder source words (e.g., `-`). This fixed the initial issue where language codes like `nan-hbl`, `es`, `grc`, `la` were incorrectly added as words.
*   **Added Handling for `blend` Templates:**
    *   Detects `blend` templates.
    *   Extracts component words (usually from `args["2"]` and `args["3"]`).
    *   Creates `RelationshipType.RELATED` relationships between the main word and its components, adding `{"relation_origin": "blend"}` to the metadata. (Assumes blend components are in the same language as the main word).
*   **Added Handling for `inh` (Inherited) Templates:**
    *   Detects `inh` templates.
    *   Extracts the proto-language code (e.g., `poz-pro`) and proto-word (e.g., `*giliÅ‹`).
    *   Cleans the proto-word (removes leading `*`).
    *   Uses `get_or_create_word_id` to get/create an entry for the proto-word with its language code.
    *   Creates a `RelationshipType.DERIVED_FROM` relationship from the current word to the proto-word.
    *   Creates the inverse `RelationshipType.ROOT_OF` relationship from the proto-word to the current word.
*   **Added Handling for `cog` (Cognate) Templates:**
    *   Detects `cog` templates.
    *   Extracts the cognate language code and cognate word.
    *   Uses `get_or_create_word_id` for the cognate word/language.
    *   Creates a `RelationshipType.COGNATE_OF` relationship (bidirectional) between the current word and the cognate word. *Correction applied: Explicitly inserts both directions as `insert_relation` doesn't handle bidirectionality automatically.*
*   **Added Handling for `doublet` Templates:**
    *   Detects `doublet` templates.
    *   Extracts the doublet word (assumes same language).
    *   Uses `get_or_create_word_id` for the doublet word.
    *   Creates a `RelationshipType.DOUBLET_OF` relationship (bidirectional) between the current word and the doublet word. *Correction applied: Explicitly inserts both directions as `insert_relation` doesn't handle bidirectionality automatically.*

## 2. Form Processing Improvements

*   **Skipped Invalid Dialectal Forms:** Added a check within the `forms` processing loop to skip entries tagged `dialectal` where the `form` text appears to be a region name (e.g., "Rizal", "Laguna") rather than an actual word form.

## 3. Top-Level Relation Field Processing

*   Added logic *before* template processing to handle relation arrays (`derived`, `related`, `synonyms`, `antonyms`) found at the top level of a Kaikki entry, similar to how they are processed within senses.
    *   Uses `RelationshipType.ROOT_OF` for top-level `derived` (word -> derived).
    *   Uses `RelationshipType.RELATED`, `RelationshipType.SYNONYM`, `RelationshipType.ANTONYM` for the others.
    *   Includes insertion of inverse relationships where appropriate.

## 4. Database Component Updates

*   **Added `RelationshipType` Enum Members:**
    *   Added `COGNATE_OF` (`"cognate_of"`)
    *   Added `DOUBLET_OF` (`"doublet_of"`)
*   **Verified Helper Functions:**
    *   `get_or_create_word_id`: Confirmed it handles various language codes and cleaned proto-words correctly. No changes were made, but noted potential extension for an `is_proto` flag if desired.
    *   `insert_relation`: Confirmed it handles the new enum types but *does not* automatically insert inverse relations for bidirectional types, necessitating explicit inverse calls in the processing logic.

These changes aim to create a more accurate and comprehensive representation of the linguistic information present in the Kaikki JSONL data within the database.
