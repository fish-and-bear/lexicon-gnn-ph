## üîÑ Manual Actions Required

### Large File Removal
You may want to manually remove these large files if they're not needed for your deployment:

```bash
# Large database file (1.1GB)
rm fil_relex_colab.sqlite

# Large CSV files (3.8MB+)
rm uncertain_word_nodes_sorted_by_entropy.csv
rm hgmae_pretrain_20250516_215159_proposed_new_links.csv
rm hgmae_pretrain_20250516_215159_anomalous_existing_links.csv

# Analysis images
rm uncertainty_distribution_*.png
rm 136207_6-27.jpg

# Experimental Python scripts (if not needed)
rm post_pretraining_analysis.py
rm KG_Enhancement_Analysis_Colab.py
rm ml_pipeline_colab_script.py
rm pos_tagging_colab_script.py

# Jupyter notebooks (if not needed)
rm ml_pipeline_colab.ipynb

# Virtual environment directories
rm -rf .venv-ml-py312/
rm -rf .venv-ml-py311/
```

### Environment Setup
1. Create a production `.env` file with proper values
2. Set up your production database
3. Configure your deployment platform environment variables
4. Set up monitoring and logging for production

### Final Verification
- [ ] Test the application in production environment
- [ ] Verify all features work without debug code
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Verify security configurations
- [ ] Test deployment process

## üìù Additional Recommendations

### Before Going Live
1. **Security Audit**: Review all environment variables and secrets
2. **Performance Testing**: Load test the application
3. **Monitoring Setup**: Configure error tracking and performance monitoring
4. **Backup Strategy**: Set up database backup procedures
5. **Documentation**: Ensure all team members understand the production setup

### Maintenance
1. **Logging**: Monitor application logs for any issues
2. **Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
3. **Security**: Regular security updates and audits
4. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize performance metrics
