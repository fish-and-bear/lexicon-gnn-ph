\begin{abstract}
We present the Philippine Lexicon GNN Toolkit, a production-ready system that demonstrates the application of heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs) to enhance lexical knowledge graphs for low-resource Philippine languages. The system addresses the critical gap in NLP resources for underrepresented languages by automatically predicting lexical relationships using a trained GATv2 model. Our live demonstration at \url{https://explorer.hapinas.net/} showcases real-time link prediction, interactive graph visualization, and cultural language features including Baybayin script support. The system achieves strong empirical performance (AUC: 0.994) on Tagalog data and includes comprehensive evaluation by 10 Philippine linguistics experts. The toolkit is fully open-source with MIT licensing, providing a scalable framework for lexicon enhancement that can be applied to other low-resource languages. This demonstration highlights the potential of GNN-based approaches for preserving linguistic diversity and advancing digital inclusion for underrepresented language communities.

\section{Introduction}

The advancement of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages is critically hampered by the scarcity of comprehensive lexical-semantic resources. This deficit is particularly acute for Philippine languages, where the lack of structured knowledge not only impedes technological development but also risks the irreversible loss of linguistic heritage. The Philippine Lexicon GNN Toolkit addresses this challenge through a novel application of heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs) to automatically enhance and expand multilingual lexical knowledge graphs.

Our system demonstrates several key innovations: (1) the first application of heterogeneous GNNs specifically designed for Philippine language lexicon enhancement, (2) real-time link prediction capabilities with interactive visualization, (3) cultural integration through Baybayin script support, and (4) comprehensive evaluation by expert linguists. The live demonstration showcases a production-ready system that can serve as a blueprint for similar applications in other low-resource language contexts.

\section{Problem Statement and System Importance}

\subsection{What Problem Does the Proposed System Address?}

The system addresses three critical challenges in low-resource language NLP:

\textbf{Extreme Data Sparsity:} Philippine languages suffer from severe lack of annotated lexical data, with most languages having fewer than 10,000 documented words compared to millions for high-resource languages. Traditional NLP approaches struggle with such sparse data.

\textbf{Multi-Relational Complexity:} Lexical units are interconnected through diverse relation types (synonymy, translation, cognation, derivation) spanning multiple languages. Effective models must differentiate and predict these varied relations within a unified framework.

\textbf{Linguistic Validation Gap:} Current automated lexicon expansion methods lack mechanisms for generating human-interpretable explanations, making them unsuitable for adoption by linguists and language communities.

\subsection{Why is the System Important and What is its Impact?}

The system's importance extends across technological, cultural, and scientific domains:

\textbf{Digital Language Divide:} Addresses the critical bottleneck in developing NLP capabilities for the long tail of the world's languages, supporting global initiatives for digital inclusivity.

\textbf{Language Preservation:} Provides scalable tools for language documentation and preservation, safeguarding linguistic diversity for future generations and supporting mother-tongue based education.

\textbf{Research Advancement:} Contributes to transparent, trustworthy, and human-centric AI systems that can learn from limited data and articulate linguistic reasoning.

\textbf{Practical Applications:} Enables downstream NLP applications including machine translation, information retrieval, and educational tools for currently underserved linguistic communities.

\section{Novelty and Technical Approach}

\subsection{What is the Novelty in the Approach/Technology?}

Our system introduces several novel technical contributions:

\textbf{Heterogeneous GNN Architecture for Lexical Semantics:} We design a specialized heterogeneous graph neural network architecture uniquely tailored for multilingual lexical data, implementing GATv2, GraphSAGE, and R-GCN variants optimized for discovering nuanced lexical-semantic relations.

\textbf{Low-Resource Optimization:} The framework is designed with computational accessibility in mind, prioritizing deployment on widely available computing resources rather than specialized high-performance infrastructure.

\textbf{Cultural Integration:} First system to integrate Baybayin script support with modern NLP techniques, preserving cultural context while advancing technological capabilities.

\textbf{Expert Validation Framework:} Comprehensive evaluation methodology involving Philippine linguistics experts, providing human-in-the-loop validation for automated predictions.

\subsection{How Does the System Work?}

The system operates through a three-stage pipeline:

\textbf{1. Heterogeneous Graph Construction:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Nodes represent lexical units (words) from multiple Philippine languages
    \item Edges represent diverse lexical relationships (synonymy, translation, cognation, derivation)
    \item Node features include character-level embeddings and language-specific metadata
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. GNN-Based Link Prediction:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item GATv2 model with 4 attention heads processes heterogeneous graph structure
    \item Learns representations capturing both local neighborhood patterns and global semantic relationships
    \item Outputs confidence scores for potential lexical relationships
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3. Interactive Visualization and Validation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Real-time graph visualization using D3.js
    \item Interactive exploration of predicted relationships
    \item Cultural features including Baybayin script conversion
\end{itemize}

\section{Target Audience and System Comparison}

\subsection{Who is the Target Audience?}

The system serves multiple stakeholder groups:

\textbf{Linguists and Researchers:} Provides tools for automated lexicon expansion and validation, supporting linguistic research and documentation efforts.

\textbf{Language Communities:} Enables preservation and enhancement of linguistic heritage through accessible digital tools.

\textbf{NLP Developers:} Offers a scalable framework for developing language technology for low-resource languages.

\textbf{Educators:} Supports mother-tongue based education through enhanced lexical resources.

\textbf{Policy Makers:} Demonstrates practical approaches for digital inclusion and language preservation initiatives.

\subsection{How Does it Compare with Existing Systems?}

Our system addresses key limitations of existing approaches:

\textbf{Traditional KGE Methods:} Unlike TransE, DistMult, or RotatE which assume homogeneous graphs, our heterogeneous GNN explicitly models diverse node and edge types inherent in multilingual lexical data.

\textbf{Standard GNNs:} Unlike GCN or GAT which assume homogeneous graphs, our approach handles the complexity of multiple languages and relation types within a unified framework.

\textbf{Manual Lexicography:} Provides scalable automation while maintaining human oversight through expert validation, addressing the bottleneck of manual lexicon creation.

\textbf{Cross-lingual Transfer:} Unlike methods that rely on parallel corpora, our approach leverages graph structure to enable knowledge transfer across languages with minimal parallel data.
